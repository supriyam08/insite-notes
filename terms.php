			<p>2breads may also in certain categories require Service Professionals to make payments for following up on job leads i.e. requests posted by Service Users, and permitting the Service Professional to contact the Service User (&ldquo;Lead Fee&rdquo;) irrespective of whether the job leads eventually result in a transaction or exchange of consideration for the service requested. In order to be eligible to make such Lead Fee payment, Service Professionals shall be required to make advance payments (&ldquo;Credits&rdquo;) from which the Lead Fee may be deducted as and when necessary.
